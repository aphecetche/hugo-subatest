<p>For many years, the origin of non-thermal cosmic radiation is a very stimulating field of researches. Recent results at the Pierre Auger Observatory have maybe opened a new window in the domain of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays: the arrival directions of the charged cosmic particles (above 10^19 eV) can be correlated to the locations of active galactic nuclei (The Pierre Auger collaboration, Science 318, November 2007). These objects could be the source of the radiation but definite conclusions can only be made when more statistic and better detection performances can be obtained. To gain fairly quickly this necessary vault, improvement of the Extensive Air Showers (EAS) detection in terms of surface, duty cycle and cost could be required.</p>

<p>High-energy cosmic rays are detected indirectly by the observation of the giant shower of secondary particles they induce in the atmosphere, with particle detectors on the ground or fluorescence/Cherenkov light detectors. Their characterization requires the simultaneous measurement of several parameters and high statistics. Radio detection of electric field pulses, with or without the associated use of other methods of detection, may provide a major and decisive contribution to high-energy cosmic ray research. The potentialities of this detection technique are the possibility to determine the direction, energy and nature of the primary, together with a high duty cycle and a relatively low cost.</p>
